# 127-honors-project-files

Author: Ze Hong Wu

## What is this?

This GitHub repository contains some files for an old honors class project.

## Why does this exist?

A couple years back, when I was deleting some repositories of little value from my GitHub profile, I accidentally deleted the GitHub repo for the `github.io` website page containing the important bits of my work for this project. Only recently did I realize this fact. To this end I have gathered up what files I have on this project and collected it all in this repo.

To learn about the significance of each of the `.pdf` files, continue reading this README.

## What is this project about?

For this project the group I was assigned to was tasked to analyze [an open-source data set on Airbnb locations in New York City](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data), more specifically Airbnb locations in the Bronx. Over the course of the project our group pruned and cleaned the data, carried out analysis on this cleaned data, and presented our findings through various graphs and charts presented in the form of several `github.io` webpages.

## What is the significance of these files?

[hc8_individual.pdf](../blob/master/hc8_individual.pdf) contains some data analysis I carried out as well as a snippet of poorly formatted Python code that I wrote to do this analysis. [This repo](https://github.com/Sowjan95/HC8) contains the combined code and graphs of the entire team. Since we were not well versed with GitHub at the time of that repo's creation, we sent over all of our work to the repo owner who then pushed the work to the repo on their device.

[hc9.pdf](../blob/master/hc9.pdf) contains an html map I generated using `folium` and the code behind it. It is not as relevant to the project as the other files.

[hc10.pdf](../blob/master/hc10.pdf) contains a couple of screenshots of my now deleted `github.io` website and a link to the website. Navigating to the link will yield a 404 error. The screenshots are proof that the website did exist at one point.

[hc11.pdf](../blob/master/hc11.pdf) contains screenshots of the main `github.io` website that summarizes our group's findings and a link to the website. This website is still functional, as are the websites for the other group members.
